# Challenge_2_AP - Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
For this challenge, we were asked to create a professional developer portfolio for future employers to review our work, contact informaton, and links to our respective networking accounts.  The completed project features flex box properties used to style the navigation links and applications under Featured Work.  Media queries were also employed to make the flex box items collapse to column upon reaching a smaller screen width.  Pseudoclass of hover was employed to make clickable text turn yellow upon hover and to change opacity of application images upon hover.
